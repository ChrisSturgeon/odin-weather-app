## Overview

The weather project from the _Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs_ module of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The aim was to create a page which would retrieve and display weather data from [OpenWeather's API](https://openweathermap.org/) for a user's given search location.

### Built With

- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [OpenWeather's Free API](https://openweathermap.org/)
- HTML
- CSS

## Features

- Detailed current weather report and five day forecast.
- Searchable by location. 
- Imperial or Metic units 


### Concepts and Ideas Learnt

- How to use **asynchronous functions** to retrieve data and to use the data within the fufilled promise elsewhere in the code base. 
- The concept of how **APIs** work and why **API keys** are often required for security and to control the number of uses. 
- The limitations and pitfalls of using an **image as a background** when accross a range of screen sizes. 

### Areas to Improve

If I was to remake or improve this project I would:

- Include more detail  in the five-day forecast, such as giving a summary of morning, afternoon and evening weather for each day.
- Improve the responsiveness of the design across a wider range of screen sizes.
